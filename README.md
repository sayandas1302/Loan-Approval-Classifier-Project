# Loan-Approval-Classifier-Project
The project is a loan approval classifier with a Flask web app, which predicts loan approval based on customer details using machine learning.

### Description:

The Loan Approval Classifier is a machine learning project that predicts whether a loan request will be approved or not based on various customer details such as income, gender, marital status, and loan amount. The project includes several stages such as exploratory data analysis, missing value handling, scaling, encoding, and model building. The project also includes a Flask web app that allows users to input customer details and receive a loan approval prediction. 

### Files:
- 3 Jupyter Notebook files respectively for EDA, preprocessing and model building
- A Python script for the Flask web app
- A PDF file for the written report
- A video demoing the web app
- A requirements.txt file for the Python dependencies
- The dataset used for the project is provided in CSV format.
- Some pickle file storing models or scaler

### Installing Dependencies
1. Download the Folder.
2. Inside the folder, create a virtual environment.
3. Once you've activated the virtual environment, run the command "pip install -r requirements.txt" to install all the dependencies specified in the requirements.txt file.

### Running the web app
1. Create a virtual environment inside the folder. If already created ignore the step.
2. Activate the virtual environment.
3. Make sure that all the dependencies that are mentioned in the requirements.txt are installed in the virtual environment. If not installed you can check the "Installing Dependencies" section.
4. In the console of the previously actiavted virtual environment, run the command "python webapp.py". It will show a poratal in the console. Copy the local host portal and paste it in any browser and press enter. The app will start to run in the browser.
